# Password-Generator

## Description
<p>This project is to produce a password generator that gives the user an option of using uppercase, lowercase, letters, numbers and special characters to provide them with a random password within the minimum of 8 and the maximum of 128 characters.</p>

This goal was achieved by following these steps: </br>
    •Generating a prompt to ask how many characters you would like your password to be. </br>
    • Generating multiple confirm prompts to ask which characters you would like to include and not include into your password. </br>
    • Creating if statements to tell the code what to do if the user wanted or did not want certain characters. </br>
    • Created a for loop to pass through the "true" arguments using the mathfloor and mathrandom functions to multiply times the password length to provide the generated password. </br>
